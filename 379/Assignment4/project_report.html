	<h1>Objectives</h1>
	<p>
        This project give me  the experience of developing multithreaded programs that require thread <br>
		synchronization and deadlock prevention. In order to protect the critical section during the <br>
		multithreading, using the semaphores our mutex implementation could efficiently prevent one <br>
		section (e.g. critical section) to be accessed by multiple threads at the same time, which prevent <br>
		the race condition and deadlock during multithreading.
	</p>



	<h1>Design Overview</h1>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Multithread creation is done by pthread_create and pthread_join from pthread library from linux. <br>
				The preventation of race condition is done by calling the API of mutex, such as mutex_lock and <br>
				mutex_unlock.
			</li>
			<li>
				Program may have up to 10 resource types, and 25 tasks. A task or a resource type name has at most 32 characters. <br>
				Each white space between fields is composed of one, or more, space character(s), and there here is no white space <br>
				around the ’:’ field separator. This composes of inputFile.
			</li>
			<li>
				Each task is defined by taking certain amount of resources and run as a task thread. If the resource is not available,<br>			</li>
				then the task will wait until the resource is available, and finish its tasks.
			<li>
				There is a monitor thread that will record the current status of all task threads, which in "WAIT", "IDLE" and "RUN" <br>
				categories.  
			</li>
			<li>
				When all task threads finish running, then the monitor thread will exit too. The final report for the whole process <br>
				will be printed on the screen.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>



	<h1>Project status</h1>
	<p>
	You can successfully create numbers of task thread and the monitor thread.<br>
	The idle and busy time is defined by the line inside the input File. You can set the monitor time, which will print<br>
	the current status of all task thread per millisecond. You can also define the number of times that each task need <br>
	to run (i.e. define the number of iterations).
	<p>The difficult part of this assignment is: 
	<ul>
		<li>
			1)It takes time to understand the mutex library and pthread library, as well as how to use them correctly.
		</li>

		<li>
			2)Parsing information is very complex; regular expression could be a great helper for future implementation.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	</p>


	<h1>Testing and Results</h1>
	<p>
		The way that I did test my program is firstly using the command example from assignment description, while since I <br>
		am trying to make the program looks like the one as description shows. Then I tried with multiple unit of resources<br>
		for testing the reliability of mutex and task implementation.

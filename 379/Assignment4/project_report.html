	<h1>Objectives</h1>
	<p>
        This project give me  the experience of developing multithreaded programs that require thread <br>
        synchronization and deadlock prevention.
	</p>



	<h1>Design Overview</h1>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				There is only one controller and 7 switches exist, which controller will listen all 7 switches and be able to recieve the message (e.g. requesting for open port) from swithes and also need to send back message (e.g. allow for connection). My program can indeed create a controller and numbers of switches that can communicate with each other through fifo. My switch will send open request to controller; and controller will send switches the allowance message for confirmation.
			</li>
			<li>
				My program also can recieve multi-I/O from different sources without interruption.
			</li>
			<li>
				The message that send between controller and switch are construct as string. After controller/switch gets the message, it will parse the string based on pre-defined rules. In the later implementation, the c struct should be used for construct the message.
			</li>
			<li>
				My program also keep updating the current statistics about the packet sent and recieved; as well as the number of package got and lost during processing the packet. The "list" command inside the controller and switch program can list the current statistics of the package information. "Exit" command will terminate the program
			</li>
			<li>
				The file descriptor is stored in an array which allows the dynamically opening the number of switches and also to ensure no more switches will pass packets (ignore the packets).
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>



	<h1>Project status</h1>
	<p>
	You can successfully create controller and swithes by using correct function call.<br>
	Each time a new swith starts, it will sends message to controller; and then, the controller will sends confirm message back.<br>
	"list" command in each process will print out the current statistics of the package information; and "exit" command will terminate the program <br>
	<p>The difficult part of this assignment is: 
	<ul>
		<li>
			1)It is not clear how to transmit the message with c struct; hence I used the string as structure of message.
		</li>

		<li>
			2)Parsing information is very complex; regular expression could be a great helper for future implementation, especially with more complex packet structure.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	</p>


	<h1>Testing and Results</h1>
	<p>
		The way that I did test my program is firstly using the command example from assignment description, while since I am trying to make the program looks like the one as description shows. Then I tested with some extreme values such as try to send package with destination port address 100000; which clearly, no switch will accept since each switch's acceptable range is less than hundreds <br>
		For the number of switches, if user limit 5 swithes by using command "./a2sdn cont 5", then after create 5 switches from 5 terminals, any later new switches won't be able to send any packet to the controller, nor controller will establish the connection with the out-of-limited switches.
